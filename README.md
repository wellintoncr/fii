# FIIs Extractor

## Idea

This project is intended to extract FIIs (*Fundos de Investimento Imobili√°rio*, in Portuguese) from Bovespa reports. Usually, there are two types of useful reports: monthly report and dividend report. The former is an overview about this investment and it is released once a month, usually. The latter is, as its name suggests, a report about dividend performance and it is released once a month, usually.

### What it does NOT do

If you are looking for information that is not present in any of the above reports, you can improve this project to do so, but currently it supports only two reports.

### What it WILL (maybe) do

These two reports contain more information than collected by this project. Maybe, it would be useful to get more fields and it is quite simple to do: just inspect the page and look for a pattern.
